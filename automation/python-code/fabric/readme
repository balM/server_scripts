FABRIC
http://docs.fabfile.org/en/1.6/

Fabric is a Python (2.5 or higher) library and command-line tool for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems administration tasks.
It provides a basic suite of operations for executing local or remote shell commands (normally or via sudo) and uploading/downloading files, as well as auxiliary functionality such as prompting the running user for input, or aborting execution.

#	Install fabric:
#	apt-get install fabric
#
#

BIG FAT NOTE:
-by default, on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, the fabric version is 0.9.0 (pretty old) and this version comes with a LOT of limitations.
For example this WILL NOT WORK:

[code above]
def copy_to_remote():
        # run with: fab dev_server copy_to_remote:/home/andy/test_deployment/fabric-test
        # make sure the directory is there!
        # create a directory
        now = datetime.datetime.now()
        remote_dir = now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d---%H:%M")
        with cd(remote_path):
                run('mkdir -p %s' % remote_dir)

FAIL !!!        put(filename, remote_dir)
                with cd(remote_dir):
[code below]

When running the file, we get the error:
Fatal error: put() encountered an exception while uploading 'some_folder'
Underlying exception message:
Is a directory
Aborting.
				

Unfortunately, this is a limitation of Paramiko; its SFTP module is only capable of handling one file at a time.

If you look in fabric.contrib.project there's an upload_project function which gets around this by tarring up the directory, sftp'ing that, then untarring it again. From your perspective it's just what you ask for, you give it a local directory and remote location and it does the job.
